#lets create a list of fruits and access the 0th elements along with making it's first letter caapital
fruits = ['banana','apple','orange']
#print(fruits[0].title())


#Python has a special syntax for accessing the last element in a list. By asking for the item at index -1, Python always returns the last item in the list
print(fruits[-1].title())
